How to use game development for self satisfaction. When you work for a long time on the same project with a team, it's nice to finish something quickly on your own.

## Motivation

When you work for a long time in same place, you can sometimes feel like you never finish a project. Yes, you add new features, you finish your sprints, but this is not the end. After one code change there will be another, and this is good, it pays your bills. But sometimes it would be nice to do something different. Maybe use a different language, challenge yourself, try something new and get it done quickly.

## MVP games

Not many developers write games as their day to day job. For many it was a motivation to start coding, but most developers are employed to do something else. If you are not a game developer, how can you build a game quickly? When I say quickly, I mean literally one evening. And here comes an idea I had couple years ago, what would be the most minimalistic UI for any game, it could be a console application. There are many games you could implement this way. TicTacToe, Minesweeper, ConnectFour they can use column and row as an input, but you can use arrows to move on a board and create Snake, Sokoban or Sliding Puzzle. You may think about other games to implement.
